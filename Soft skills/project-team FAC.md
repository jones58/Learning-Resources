# Project roles

While working in project teams of four, you will each pick one of the roles below.

We have listed a set of responsibilities for each role - but do keep in mind that your main role on the project is as a developer. The project roles are areas of focus that you should ensure get done **as a team**

For example - If you are the UX Lead, do not feel obliged to do all the CSS/styling work. Your role is to make sure that the project as a whole is well designed and styled, and that the whole team works towards that goal.

# Technical Spikes

A ["spike"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_(software_development)>) is a method for exploring potential solutions. They are usually used when a team needs to get familiar with a new technology, or does not know how to solve an important problem. The spike is a dedicated period of time to research a solution, which can then inform the project planning.

Every week your project will begin with a spike. There will be some aspect of the project that you need to research and plan as a group before starting to work on your app. There is dedicated time in the schedule for this.

During the first 6 weeks, spikes will include some example questions to kickstart your research. During the longer In-house and Tech for Better projects, project teams will decide their own Technical Spikes. Please include your findings in your project presentations at the end of the weekâ€”it's useful for each group to share their specific knowledge with the others.

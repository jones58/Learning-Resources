To create an accessibility color scheme change on a website using HTML and CSS, you can follow these steps:

1.  Choose the color palette that will be used for the accessibility feature. This may include high contrast color combinations or colors that are easier to distinguish for users with color vision deficiencies.
2.  Add a button or link to the page that will allow users to switch to the alternative color scheme. For example, you could add a button with the label "Toggle High Contrast Mode."
3.  Define the alternative color scheme in CSS using a separate class or ID selector. For example, you could create a class called "high-contrast" that applies the alternative color scheme to the relevant elements.
4.  Use JavaScript to add an event listener to the button or link that toggles the high-contrast class on and off when clicked. You can achieve this using the `classList.toggle()` method.

Here's an example of what the HTML and CSS might look like:

HTML:

bash

`<button id="toggle-contrast">Toggle High Contrast Mode</button>`

CSS:

css

`/* Default color scheme */ body {   background-color: white;   color: black; }  /* High contrast color scheme */ .high-contrast body {   background-color: black;   color: white; }`

JavaScript:

javascript

`const toggleContrastButton = document.querySelector('#toggle-contrast'); toggleContrastButton.addEventListener('click', function() {   document.body.classList.toggle('high-contrast'); });`

When the button is clicked, the `high-contrast` class will be toggled on and off for the `body` element, which will change the color scheme of the page. You can apply this approach to other elements on the page as well, such as buttons, links, and headings.

# Tailwind

- People find it easier to customise than Bootstrap. Can use SASS with Bootstrap but Tailwind is much more customisable by itself.
- Adds limitations so it forces you to design well.
- Once you learn classes, you can apply CSS classes very quickly.

- Used this tutorial to build first project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxcTsOHrjo

- When want to look something up in tailwind, use the quick search in docs page: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

- keep reading core concepts from here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states

- npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./build/css/style.css --watch have to do a command like this each time start up project again, e.g. if shut down computer - this can be set as script in package.json

- set custom css in the input css file, where you set a custom class.

- can use npx init -y to start up project, and set tailwindcss in scripts in package.json.

- using prettier with tailwind will automatically organise the class list for us.

- press cmd j in vs code to hide show terminal
- press up down arrow keys to scroll through previous commands
- press alt z to wrap code - can be useful to see stuff when on split screen.

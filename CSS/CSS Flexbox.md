Makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout without float or positioning

- define a flex container in html doc

``flex-wrap:wrap`` when elements cannot fit on the same line, push onto next line. 

``flex-direction`` for column or row or either of those reversed.

``flex-basis`` used to set initial scale of elements, e.g. 100px, 50% etc. 

``flex-grow:`` will grow in line with other items if space, 1 for equal with other items, 2 for double
``flex-shrink:`` will grow in line with other items if space, 1 for equal with other items, 2 for double

``align-content`` for vertical alignment 

``justify-content`` for horizontal alignment 

``align-items`` to align a specific element 


- To make flex items go onto the next line if they are overflowing the viewport, you can use the `flex-wrap` property with a value of `wrap`.

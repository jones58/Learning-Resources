# User research

## An Intro to research

Validating an idea with a user group is an important part of software development

Feedback from your users will be analysed and inform the direction of the Product

## Qualitative vs Quantitative

There are two main avenues to analysing results from testing:

- Qualitative
- Quantitative

**Qualitative research** seeks to understand subjective experiences and perspectives through non-numerical data.

**Quantitative research** uses numerical data to analyze relationships and draw objective conclusions.

## How do we conduct research analysis?

Research analysis is split into 3 - 15 minute sessions:

1. **SUMMARISE** the notes your product owner shares with you from their user research.
2. **REFLECT** on themes that summarise the notes from the first step.
3. **ANALYSE** the themes from the second step and ask "What does this mean?"

## Definition

Definition focuses on moving from an idea to something we can prototype. It is broken down into a number of exercises:

1. **INSPIRATIONS** - Draw from other sources (websites, mobile phone apps etc) to get an idea of what we might include in the app.
2. **LIGHTNING TALKS** - Discuss, with your team, your rationale for the screens you have chosen from the previous step.
3. **CRAZY EIGHTS** - Draw 8 lightning sketches in 8 minutes, 1 minute for each drawing.
4. **THE BIG IDEA** - Take _one_ design from your Crazy 8's and create a ore detailed sketch of it.
5. **UPLOAD** - Take some time to upload your designs onto your miro board.
6. **DISCUSS** - Come together to discuss your sketches and think about elements you want to take into the next step.
7. **LOW FIDELITY WIREFRAMES** - Take a few of the screens from the _Crazy Eights_ step and recreate them as screens on Miro.
8. **DOT VOTE** - Mark what draws your attention or interest on Miro.
9. **DISCUSS** - Come together to discuss what youâ€™ve created and what to move forward with.

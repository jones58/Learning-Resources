# Figma Workshop 1 (90 minutes)

## What is prototyping?

_"Prototyping is a quick way to go from sketches or wireframes to a simulation where you can get user feedback"_ - [Tom Lowry, Director of Advocacy at Figma](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-prototyping/)

## Why is it important?

_"The goal of a prototype is to ensure your design works in the hands of the user. Getting feedback on a prototype is one of the easiest and cheapest ways to get feedback, before you spend a lot of money building something that might not meet user needs"_ [Tom Lowry, Director of Advocacy at Figma](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-prototyping/)

## What will you be doing today?

**You will be building a clickable Figma prototype.**

It's ok if you haven't used Figma before we've put together some resources, that you can find [**here**](/course/syllabus/tfb/week%204/resources/)

## Remember

- Send a link to the Figma prototype to the product owners and ask them to add comments about elements they would like changed on Miro.

## For Product Owners

This week you should start thinking about creating a short summary/product pitch video for the developers to watch and decide which project they would like to work on. Even if your project is not chosen in week 9 you can use this video to pitch your idea and research to stakeholders or developers in the future.

Here are a few things to think about when creating your pitches:

- WHAT is the name of the product? (This can be a placeholder name)
- WHAT is the product supposed to do? (A blurb about what the product is supposed to do?)

**Example**

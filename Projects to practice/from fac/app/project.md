Your project this week is to build a frontend for one of the APIs from REST API week. It should be a single-page app rendered with client-side JavaScript.

If your team don't have a finished API, or don't want to use it, you can use the [Dogs API](https://github.com/oliverjam/dog-rest-api/) from the workshops. The readme contains documentation of all the endpoints.

## User stories

### Core

- **As a user, I want to**: see all the resources
- **As a user, I want to**: sign up for an account
- **As a user, I want to**: log in to my account
- **As a user, I want to**: add my own resources

### Stretch

- **As a user, I want to**: update my own resources
- **As a user, I want to**: delete my own resources

Since this project is open-ended you'll need to write your own more specific user stories once you know what you want to build.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A single-page app (only one HTML file)
- [ ] Accessible signup/login forms

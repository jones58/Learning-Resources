## Single-page app

### Client rendering

- [ ] Make `fetch` requests to our own server for JSON data
- [ ] Render elements in the DOM based on the server data
- [ ] Submit data to our own server, then update the DOM based on the response

### Error handling

- [ ] Respond with useful error information to the client
- [ ] Throw errors when our server hits a problem
- [ ] Catch errors and log them correctly
- [ ] Handle errors that occur in async code
- [ ] Show the user useful messages based on server errors

## Design (UI/UX)

- [ ] Account for all possible states of a network request
- [ ] Design and create an accessible loading spinner

## Testing

- [ ] Mock `fetch` calls in our tests to avoid hitting our real API
- [ ] Test dynamic client-side interactions to ensure they behave as we expect
- [ ] Test all of our error handling

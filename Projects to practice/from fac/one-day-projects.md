# One-day projects

## Preparation

A one-day project needs as a minimum the following:

- One clearly-defined topic
- A well-defined task (or tasks)
- Links to relevant resources

The **_topic_** will usually be around a specific language, library or technology, such as Docker, D3, Elm, or TypeScript.

The **_task_** (or tasks) needs to be something that can reasonably be completed in 5-6 hours.

The **_resources_** need to be well-researched learning materials that will provide a sufficient introduction to the topic.

## Facilitation

A well-prepared project day does not need a facilitator, but facilitating them can be fun.

Facilitators may:

- Prepare an introduction to the topic or do a workshop or code-along at the start of the day;
- Make themselves available (either in-person or online) to support the teams while the task is being worked on;
- Participate in the project presentations at the end of the day.

## Teams

By default, work in teams of 4. Larger teams are more likely to be self-contained and not need too much support.

## Presentations

One hour before the scheduled end of the day, all teams take it in turns to present their work.

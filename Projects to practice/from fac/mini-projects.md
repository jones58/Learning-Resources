# Mini projects

Web browsers are very powerful nowadays. They support lots of cool features that let your code do interesting things. For example webcam filters, text-to-speech and geolocation.

You're going to spend the day experimenting with some of these features to build a fun mini project (in pairs). The idea is to get some experience figuring things out reading MDN docs, and have fun building something silly.

We'll come back together at 16:00 to present what we've made to the group. You'll have 10 minutes to show off your project and talk about anything interesting you learnt.

Wes Bos' [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) video series is a great introduction to some of these topics. They're pretty fast-paced and concise, and give you enough info to go and start experimenting to build your own thing. If you want access to the starter code you have to sign up on the site (it's free), but if you just want to watch the videos they're all [on YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu8EoSxDXHP6CGK4YVJhL_VWetA865GOH).

We'd recommend these as a starting point:

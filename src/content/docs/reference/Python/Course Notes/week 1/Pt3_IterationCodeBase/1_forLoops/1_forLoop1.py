"Iteration is the repetition of code blocks. For example, a while loop or a for loop."
# for loops is used when you have definite iteration (the number of iterations is known).
# for loop also controls the flow of execution in a program
# For loop is used for iterating through sequences. 


"for loop Syntax"
# for this sequence:
#     do this

"For loops can be used for many types of sequence, for example"
# Letters in a word
# Items in a list
# Numbers in a range
 

"To Do: Predict, then Run, and then Investigate"
"To Do: Explain the difference bewtween the Character in name code block and the name code block?"

print("Character in name  code block ")
letterInName = "Tim Jones"
print(f"The first character is: {}")
print(f"The second character is: {}")
print(f"The third character is: {}")
print(f"The fourth character is: {}")
print(f"The fifth character is: {}")
print(f"The sixth character is: {}")
print(f"The seventh character is: {}")
print(f"The eighth character is: {}")
print(f"The tenth character is: {}")


"Loop through letters in a word"
print("\nname code block")
name = "Tim Jones"



"Loop through items in a list in a word"
print("\n")
names = ["Tim", "Zak", "Waqas", "Abdul", "Chris", "Richie", "Narayan"]


"Loop through numbers in a range"
"syntax" # for variableName in rangeObject(numberOfIteration)

"for loops that use the range() function"
# range() is the sequence that you are going to iterate through
# range() is a built-in function just like input(). 

"start defaults to 0, and stop is omitted! range(4) produces 0, 1, 2, 3"

"To Do: Task 1: Create a program that uses a for loop to iterate through the letters in your name"

Accessibility S
I make an effort to meet the requirements for WCAG 2.1 level AA compliance.
This includes:
â€¢ Providing alternative text for all images on the site
â€¢ Ensuring that the site is navigable by keyboard, including "Skip to main content" and "Back to top" links to bypass blocks of content
â€¢ Setting background and foreground colors for appropriate color contrast
â€¢ Using semantic HTML, including HTML5 landmark elements such as <nav> and <main> to improve navigation for assistive technology
â€¢ Designing click targets at an appropriate size
If you happen to notice accessibility improvements that I could make for better compliance, such as if I've accidentally missed alt text on an image, please let me
know.

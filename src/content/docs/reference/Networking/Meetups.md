Meetups are an important way of learning and meeting other developers.

My list of meetups in London is [here](https://jones58.github.io/londontechmeetups.github.io/).

I regularly check:

- [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/): I joined various groups and then check their upcoming events here.
- [Luma](https://lu.ma/london)
- [Guild.host](https://guild.host/)
- [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com)

Joining WhatsApp groups of people from those meetups has served me well in keeping up-to-date with other events or meetups I can join, for example Hackathons.

title: Frontend Coding Interview
---

You can find some sites that I use to prepare for technical interviews below.

[Testdome](https://www.testdome.com/library?page=1&skillArea=31) - This site is used by hiring teams and has plenty of practice questions. Focussed on running tests and solving issues. This is a great place to start for all kinds of technical tests - whether frontend or backednd.

Some Leetcode style sample tests for frontend (mostly React):

- [Clientside dev](https://www.clientside.dev/explore)
- [Great Frontend](https://www.greatfrontend.com/)
- [Big Frontend](https://bigfrontend.dev/)
- [React Practice](https://reactpractice.dev/)
- [I code this](https://icodethis.com/)
- [Decode Frontend](https://decode-frontend.vercel.app/problems/two-sum)
- [example interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEt09iK8IXs&list=WL&index=2)

JavaScript and Typescript exercises (more similar to traditional Leetcode style test):

- [Codewars](https://codewars.com)
- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises)

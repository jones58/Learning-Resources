title: Frontend Coding Interview
---

## First Stage/Informal Interviews

- Stop before answering questions, to make sure you know what to say.
- If you have an online interview, can be helpful to have notes open on your computer.
- How to work with non technical people is worth thinking about.

## Techical Interviews

- Improve your overall coding skill, it's all about problem solving and how you break a problem down.
- Don't use AI to write your code, maybe as a teacher, but not just to spit out everything.
- Work on debugging without AI, using console.log() and tests.
- Code more!
- Unusual to use Typescript in junior dev interview, can focus on js. You can also look at how to manipulate HTML using JS.
- In the Testing IDE, you should use tests to help you code step by step, as well as the instructions. Focus on meeting one test at a time.

You can find some sites that I use to prepare for technical interviews below.

[Testdome](https://www.testdome.com/library?page=1&skillArea=31) - This site is used by hiring teams and has plenty of practice questions. Focussed on running tests and solving issues. This is a great place to start for all kinds of technical tests - whether frontend or backednd.

Some Leetcode style sample tests for frontend (mostly React):

- [Clientside dev](https://www.clientside.dev/explore)
- [Great Frontend](https://www.greatfrontend.com/)
- [Big Frontend](https://bigfrontend.dev/)
- [React Practice](https://reactpractice.dev/)
- [I code this](https://icodethis.com/)
- [Decode Frontend](https://decode-frontend.vercel.app/problems/two-sum)
- [example interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEt09iK8IXs&list=WL&index=2)

JavaScript and Typescript exercises (more similar to traditional Leetcode style test):

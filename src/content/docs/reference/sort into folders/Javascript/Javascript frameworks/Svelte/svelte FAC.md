Learn how to use Svelte to build dynamic client-side applications.

## Intro talk

## Learn

[Svelte's interactive tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/) covers all the basics. I'd recommend completing parts 1-7 before starting on the project. If you're interested in putting some fun animations into your app then you could also look at parts 9 and 10.

## Project

Today's project is similar to React Week's—build an interactive-game-like-thing with lots of dynamic client-side state. You don't have to fetch data from an external API if you don't need to—the focus is on using Svelte.

## Help each other

You don't have mentors to ask for help, so try to help each other. Use your Discord channels to stay in touch and solve problems.

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Thanks for this Lennart, lots to think about here - im gonna do some stuff for free to get some more projects done. Good to know that you managed to do so much with Wordpress - I've been hand coding using React and Javascript to build websites,  but ill have a look at using that with Wordpress or wordpress on its own. Yeh good point about screen sizes and updating, i guess it goes both ways because you can often keep clients by knowing how to edit the code later down the line. Yes,  used squarespace for clients, always felt like such an easy way to make money haha. Do you have a portfolio? Would be good to see what kind of stuff you've been up to. That was helpful yes thanks! Ive learnt html, css, js, react, tailwind and some python so far but im definitely gonna see if i can incorporate some cms into my next project. I got a bit fed up of working freelance with clients for graphic design stuff so im probably gonna try get a job in a tech company, but will probably do some freelance stuff on the side}

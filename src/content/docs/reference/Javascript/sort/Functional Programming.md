title: Functional Programming
---

- input -> process -> output, no changes outside function scope like with normal functions
- isolated functions - no global variables changing, rely only on internal values, e.g what is fed directly into it.
- functions with limited side effects - any changes happen within the function
- Callbacks: functions that are passed into another function
- First class functions: functions that are assigned to a variable, passed into another function or returned from another function like any other value. In JS all functions are first class.
- Higher order functions: take function as argument or return a function.
- lambda - name for functions passed into or returned from another function

this video is about TypeScript but is really good:

an analogy: https://sudonull.com/post/80803-Functional-programming-is-unpopular-because-it-is-weird

functional programming is a declarative form of programming whereas Object Oriented Programming is imperative - ie giving commands.

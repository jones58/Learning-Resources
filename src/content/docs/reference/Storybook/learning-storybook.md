[Storybook docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs)
Interesting perspective on the alternatives to Storybook [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxBi_Up325g&t=198s)]

Storybook is often used by big companies for their component libraries. There's a collection [here](https://storybook.js.org/showcase/projects). Of note is the [GOV.UK](https://govuk-react.github.io/govuk-react/?path=/docs/welcome--docs) component library.

Storybook aligns with the concept of [Component Driven UIs](https://componentdriven.org) - building a component and then making components and pages from those components.

The most useful Storybook tutorial, which I followed is [here](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react/en/get-started) and another useful one [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-storybook-and-how-can-i-use-it-to-create-a-component-libary-in-react/)

we can do testing in storybook [in various ways](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/ui-testing-handbook/)

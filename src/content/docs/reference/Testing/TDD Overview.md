Write failing test first.

Fail -> Pass -> Refactor

## Unit Testing

Individual functions or units of code

## Integration Testing

Testing units of code together

## End-to-End Testing

Runs code in simulated environment, e.g. Cypress

## Acceptance Testing

Tests that a user or client's requirements are met

## System Testing

Test that works on real devices

## Smoke test

Most important tests are run first, then further ones if needed. This is to prevent slowing down the system.

For websites - test every page and every user interaction, and also the components.

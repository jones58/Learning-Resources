### How I Built This Site

- Used [Astro Starlight Starter Kit](https://github.com/withastro/starlight)
- Thanks to Kyle Malloy (and the Astro community Discord) for the very handy Python script to add title frontmatter to my existing Markdown files.
- I also had a massive amount of webloc files which I wanted to turn into md files with links, so I used a Python script for that too.

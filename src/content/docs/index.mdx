### How I Built This Site

- Used Astro Starlight Starter Kit: https://github.com/withastro/starlight
- Thanks to Kyle Malloy (and the Astro community Discord) for the very handy Python script to add title frontmatter to my existing Markdown files.
- I also had a massive amount of webloc files which I wanted to turn into md files with links, so I used a Python script for that too.

### Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│ ├── assets/
│ ├── content/
│ │ ├── docs/
│ │ └── config.ts
│ └── env.d.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for .md or .mdx files in the src/content/docs/ directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to src/assets/ and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the public/ directory.

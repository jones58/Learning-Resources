# Python notes

## Running Python Scripts

Can do `python... file_name.py` to run a file, or can open a REPL in the terminal by just writing `python...`
or can just click start button.

F5 to debug.

The `-i` flag means 'open a REPL that can use the code in this file' - e.g. `python -i 017_expressions.py` in the terminal, either iTerm or in VSCode Terminal

can exit REPL by writing `exit()` or using ctrl-d

indentation is important!

## F strings

e.g. `f"hello {name}"`
The python version of template literals in js.

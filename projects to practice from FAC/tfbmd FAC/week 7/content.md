# Product pitches & Selection (90 minutes)

Video goes here

## What will we be doing in this session?

For the first 45-60 minutes we will be watching video pitches from the product owners and making notes.

We will then have a group discussion where we will discuss the products based on what you have heard and express your preferences for the top 3 projects you want to work on.

## What is Product Managment?

_"Project management is the art of getting things done... Product management is the art of deciding what to do in the first place"_- Jennifer Pahlka, author of Recoding America, on [The Ezra Klein Show](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/06/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-jennifer-pahlka.html).

Meanwhile, **Product ownership** is the **art of balancing the needs of users with your team's capabilities.**

**Product managers** need to be good at all three.

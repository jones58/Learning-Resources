We'd like you to spend some time before starting the full time course working on useful fundamentals.

1. Keep working on your [project](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/foundation/projects/project/)

2. Keep up with Execute Programme. This includes:

- JavaScript Arrays
- JavaScript Concurrency (unless you really hate it)
- Modern JavaScript
- Regular Expressions
- SQL
- If you are feeling adventurous, you could take a look at TypeScript, too.

3. Take a look ahead at the apprenticeship [curriculum](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/developer/introduction/schedule/), and particularly the first [workshop](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/learn/server/). If you want to get ahead of the game, you are welcome to give it a go before the start of term.

# Learning Resources
Resources that I've found useful in learning to code. Includes a lot of links and my own notes in Markdown format.

## How to use this repo (for now)
- Download the repo. Access it with your finder/file explorer. That's how I access it on my computer so that's how it's organised. 

## To do 
- I want to get this to the point where it's more usable for everyday users and Windows users on Github directly.
- I plan to do this by:
   - Working out a better way to display links in finder that can be viewed on github (ie. not url or webloc)
   - Organising the folders more clearly
     -  A decent file structure map on this readme

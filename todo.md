fix deploy on netlify.

set it so slug is title and don't have to set title with frontmatter
so not like this:

```
 ---
title: Example Reference
description: A reference page in my new Starlight docs site.
---
```

Change home page so it has a list of notes, like table of contents style. probably something in docs on this.

Change favicon.

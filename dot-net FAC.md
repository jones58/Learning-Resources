# .NET and Umbraco

.NET is a software development platform created by Microsoft that allows developers to create: desktop applications, web applications, mobile applications, and games. It provides a framework for building, deploying, and running applications on different platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

C# is the most widely used programming language for .NET development. C# is an object-oriented language that's designed for building robust and efficient applications. It's similar to other popular programming languages like Java and C++.

## C#

C# is a high-level programming language designed to be simple, modern, and object-oriented, primarily used for building applications that run on the .NET platform.

## Project

Your project for the next three weeks is to get stuck in learning C#, .NET and Umbraco.

1. Learn C# and .NET through online tutorials
1. Install Umbraco
1. Learn Umbraco through exploring its features on the platform
1. Build a website using Umbraco CMS

For the website you build, you can choose anything to focus on that you feel will make good use of the features available in .NET and Umbraco. If you're stuck for ideas, build a microblogging site based on [server project requirements](../syllabus/developer/server/project/).

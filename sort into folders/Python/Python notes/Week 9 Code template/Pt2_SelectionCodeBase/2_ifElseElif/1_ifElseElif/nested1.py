userAge = int(input("Enter your age: "))

ageLimit = 16

passCode = "Bootcamp"

# compare if the value held in userAge is greater than the value held in ageLimit


# execute the code block below if the comparison returns true


# nested if will execute if the codition above is true (if userAge > ageLimit:)

 # This else will execute if nested if condition above is false (userCode is not equal to passCode:)

# This else will execute if the if condition above is false ( userAge is less than the ageLimit:)

## Inspiration

Find sources of Inspiration for the look and feel of the application they're building. Look online for similar apps, colour schemes, user flows that might be drawn from for this app.

## Lightning talks

Give an overview to the rest of the team of what each individual brought from the round of finding inspiration. Each summary should be short, no more than 2 minutes.

## Generate ideas

In 8 minutes, come up with 8 unique sketches of elements to include in the app. Fold a piece of paper into 8 panels. In each of these, sketch an idea to include in the app. It could be a screen, a component or a piece of copy. The goal here is to think divergently and to pivot to a new idea after each minute is up.

## Big idea

Expand on one of the ideas you've come up with in the idea generation stage. You might sketch what comes before it, and what comes after it. Or expand on the level of detail.

## Wireframing

This low-fidelity wireframing should be done on Miro or on paper. The goal here is to start to draft what the app might look like. Focus on four main screens and the flow through the application. Low-fidelity wireframes don't need to show much detail or look fancy - they should show the context of moving through an application

## Upload

If you've been using Miro to facilitate the workshop, give each team some time to upload what they've done on paper to the board.

## Dot vote

Each person should look back over the sketches and wireframes that have been created so far. Indicate what stands out to you by placing a dot over it. This marks something you want to highlight as interesting, innovative or otherwise worth discussing.

## Discuss

Spend some time as a group discussing what has been created so far and how it will feed into the application. Reach a consensus on which ideas should be taken forward to the next stage of higher fidelity wireframing.

Usability testing gives validation of the user journey and user interface

## Scheduling

Each session should be about 20 minutes with 10 minutes in between to decompress or tidy notes

## Conducting testing

Explain little about the app but give a good introduction to testing

Disclaimers are helpful:

- we're testing the app and not you
- you can't do anything wrong
- the app isn't finished - some things won't work

Let the user lead
Ask them to speak aloud as they go through the prototype

## Synthesising the feedback

There's a few methods

Qualitative - write everything down that was said and write in depth reports
Quantative - rainbow charts or traffic lights

```let variable='some string'```
```let```can be reassigned
```const``` is a constant that can't be reassigned or changed

```console.log``` to print result 
```example.length``` to get length of string attached to the example variable
`example.replace` to change the variable, then ('x', 'y') after to change part of  the string x to y. 
`Math.round()` rounds to nearest integer
`example.toString()` makes number a string

``total += i`` adds i to total in forLoop

forLoop is 3 expressions that run over and over

``for (_expression 1_; _expression 2_; _expression 3_) {  
Â  // _code block to be executed_  
}``
where expression 1 is first statement, expression 2 is conditional statement, such as x>y, and expression 3 is executed every time after code block executed (often incremental)

array, e.g. ``x=['a','b', 'c']``

no ' for numbers

when doing array filtering, syntax is important! Can often change values and use an existing function

index number for arrays - 0,1,2 etc. for a, b and c in array. 

with objects,  example.pizza  and  example['pizza']  are the same thing

to run javascript in vs code  (using code runner extension) - just do cmd-shift-p and type run code and it will come up in output 


Scope is the set of variables, objects, and functions you have access to.  
     JavaScript has two scopes: global and local. A variable that is declared  
  outside a function definition is a global variable, and its value is  
  accessible and modifiable throughout your program. A variable that is  
  declared inside a function definition is local. It is created and  
  destroyed every time the function is executed, and it cannot be accessed  
  by any code outside the function.  

(this bit need to go over tbh as got quite confusing with different functions inside functions. Might be a better way of writing it so is less confusing)
